<h1>Choosing the  Perfect Pillow for You</h1>

<p>With the instances of car crashes growing more and more frequent, there is also an increase in minor to major injuries resulting from those collisions. If you’ve been involved in a car accident and you have recurring pain in any part of your body, it can severely disrupt your life.</p>

<p>Whether it’s a nagging limp in your leg or persistent pain in your neck, the pinches, aches, and shots of pain can make sleeping complicated, and it can make concentrating and being comfortable at work similarly tricky.</p>

<p>Did you know you can be allergy-free?  Well, at least when you sleep, if you consider trying a hypoallergenic pillow.</p>

<p>Anyone suffering from different dust allergies should seriously consider a hypoallergenic pillow.  These pillows are designed to block out allergens such as <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/allergens/dustmites/index.cfm">dust mites</a>, which we experience while sleeping.  It is also highly recommended that bedding is frequently changed as dust mites love living inside our bedding.</p>

<p>You must also consider looking at purchasing new pillows if your present pillows are older and soiled.  You may be providing the perfect home for dust mites if no changes take place!  Reducing these allergens, you breathe in at night will lessen those typical allergy symptoms such as stuffy, runny nose, sore throat, asthma attacks, congestion or itchy eyes.</p>

<p>A good set of hypoallergenic pillows will ensure you don’t have any more restless sleep at night and since we sleep about 1/3 of our lives, we need to be correctly rested to tackle the duties of the day every morning!</p>

<p>We are all created uniquely by different likes and dislikes.  This holds true for our preference of sleeping at night as well.  Some enjoy relaxing on their side while others prefer their backs and still we cannot forget those who choose their stomach.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/turnmearoundpillow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>How great to know there are pillows designed with each style of the sleeper in mind.  This may mean taking extra time to choose the pad that is right for you, but in the end, you will be so much happier for a good night’s rest.</p>

<p>Some simple facts to keep in mind while choosing that perfect pillow for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the pad creates a natural line of your head, neck, and spine</li>
  <li>One properly fitting pillow, instead of two stacked pillows, will keep everything aligned</li>
  <li>Ensure the pillow suits to your sleeping style, whether that is side, back or stomach</li>
</ul>

<p>When you know what to look for, choosing the right pillow is made easy, and you won’t have to fear to wander the aisles for hours to make your decision!  They have even designed pads to meet multiple needs.  If you perhaps are one of those people who change their preference for sleeping on your side and back throughout the night,  consider the Down and Memory Foam Cradle Pillow which will be a perfect fit.</p>

<p>The simple formula you are searching for to improve your sleep may be just a pillow away!</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, society has equated being a good employee with working long, hard hours.  We have placed ourselves into a vicious cycle of working late, grabbing fast-food meals, sleeping less than eight hours, not exercising and then starting the next day doing the same thing all over again!  This pattern is taking its toll on our health, our marriages and family life.</p>

<p>Our bodies were made to “talk” to us by the various ailments or aches and pains we may feel.  The question is when are we going to start listening to them?  What would your aching back be saying to you…let’s see?</p>

<p>If your back could talk would it ask you to move around and stretch every so often during the workday?  Would it urge you NOT to stay until dark three times a week at the office?  Would your back enjoy a walk or run for 30 minutes 5 times a week and perhaps some muscle strengthening exercises?</p>

<p>If you were to ask your back about sleep, it might say “I require at least 7-8 hours every night with supportive, comfortable pillows to keep everything aligned”.</p>

<p>Why don’t you and your back consider a memory foam spinal back pillow?  This pillow may start a relationship with your aching back that will last a lifetime!</p>

<p>Spring is commonly associated with budding flowers and beams of sunshine, but for a portion of the population, spring only means one thing: allergies. When you’re continually sneezing indoors, waking up with itchy eyes, or finding yourself congested often, it’s time to make some changes.</p>

<p>The sources of your woes are indoor allergens from pets, dust, and plants. In rare cases, allergens can come from other sources indoors, but these are by far the most common. To relieve your allergies begin by addressing the cause of allergens, especially around the bed. Don’t allow pets in the area you sleep.</p>

<p>You will also want to vacuum and dust around your bed and your whole house regularly. Switching to an allergy free pillow is also a sound idea. A home air purifier will ensure you have a much more restful sleep and will remove allergens and pollutants from the rest of the house as well.</p>

<p>Taking these simple steps should dramatically reduce allergy symptoms, and allow for a more peaceful and relaxing home life.</p>

<p>Tired of flat pillows that have lost their fullness and are no longer giving you the support you need?  Have you tried using two or perhaps three pillows to provide you with the right fullness only to have them slip and slide on you during the night?</p>

<p>The Forever Full pillow, which blends polyester fiber and polyurethane foam to create a pad, will never flatten or “bottom out.”</p>

<p>Improving sleeping posture and weight distribution allows for a more restful night’s sleep as it cradles your neck and supports the weight of your head.  As you shift and move during the night, this pillow will keep your spine aligned while your neck and shoulder muscles stay relaxed.</p>

<p>You’ll anxiously await the hour you can crawl into bed and with a lifetime warranty how you can go wrong?  Try one today!  Change the way you think about sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep apnea,  which affects 18 million Americans, is the condition whereby a person stops breathing for a few seconds during his sleep.  This results in an imbalance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body, triggering a signal to the brain, forcing a person to wake up, enabling them to expand their lungs and begin breathing normally.</p>

<p>There is both a surgical and nonsurgical method to treat sleep apnea.  If a person’s situation is not critical, they can opt for nonsurgical options which would include lifestyle changes, medicine, dental appliances or the most common, a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) mask and a BiPAP (Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure) mask.</p>

<p>Both these masks work to force the air through the nostrils so a person can breathe quickly despite having a sleep disorder problem.  A CPAP mask can decrease the sleepiness a person feels who faces sleep apnea while a BiPAP mask is helpful for people needing higher pressure to breath usually (i.e., heart disorder or lung).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/pillowcar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can imagine, using these masks during the night could cause frustrations if used with a standard shaped pillow.  We welcome you to look at the SleePAP pillow which has an exclusive design for comfort and compliance.</p>

<p>This pad allows an oxygen mask to be held in place thus preventing leaks and facial pressure points.  It has been designed for multiple sleeping positions giving you comfort in any situation - be it on your stomach, side or back.</p>

<p>These tiny organisms enjoy a warm and moist fibrous environment such as carpets, bedding, cloth furniture, etc.  For people suffering from asthma, they can be particularly dangerous.  If you are one of those people tossing and turning at night, waking up with nose and chest congestion, you may be the victim of dust mites in your bedding.</p>

<p>One of the most critical areas of our bedding is our pillow protectors as our faces rub against it all night long.  An allergy free pillow protector stops the growth of germs, mold, mildew, fungus, and bacteria which all provide a breeding ground for dust mites.</p>

<p>A dust mite free environment creates a healthier environment by improving breathing and sleep.  Considering sleep is one of the essential functions contributing to our overall health, it’s important to find a good allergy bedding solution.</p>
