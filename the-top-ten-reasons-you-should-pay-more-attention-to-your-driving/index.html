<h1>The Top Ten Reasons You Should Pay More Attention to Your Driving</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/attentiontoyourdriving.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=27629">Automobile accidents kill</a>, maim and injure an awful lot of people every single day. And every single day, everyone else thinks it will never happen to them. Unfortunately, those people that it did happen though that too, right up to the moment it did.</p>

<p>On the positive note, there are things you can do to reduce your chances of it happening to you or those who may be passengers in your car while you are driving. Below are the top ten reasons you should pay more attention to your driving and behave while out there.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Because crashing hurts. Seriously, the amount of pain involved is more than most people can even imagine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you are not as good as you think you are. Most people overrate their driving ability and skill, and thus, take chances when behind the wheel. That means that you, reading this right now, are probably not as good as you think you are and are likely to make a mistake when driving sometime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because it’s just not worth the risk. For example, by cutting someone off in traffic you might save yourself a minute, maybe two, of driving time. On the other hand, by cutting that person off, you risk having an accident that could cost you pain, time, money, inconvenience, guilt at what happens to the other person, or death. How is it worth it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you are risking the lives of others. Every time you make a risky maneuver on the road, you are putting the lives and/or well-being of others. What gives you the right to gamble with other peoples lives?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Because driving is a privilege. No doubt you’ve heard it before, but driving indeed is a privilege, not a right. One that not only can be taken away if abused but one that should be treated as something individual, not as something to be made for granted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because others may not be paying attention. Even if you are as good of a driver as you think you are, you can’t take it for granted that other drivers around you are too, or that they are even paying attention. So if you pull something, others might not react in time to head off something you’ve started.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you aren’t any more special than anyone else. There is something about the anonymity of driving that causes people to feel isolated from what is going on around them. This, in turn, gives people a false sense of their place and importance on the road, which causes people to drive as if they should have exclusive rights or privileges. The problem with all this is, you’re not any more special than anyone else.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/drivingisaprivilege.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Because your life and those you love are in your hands. Try to consider this fact. Every single time you get in an automobile, you are taking your life in your hands. It could be on your very next trip that you get in an accident and get hurt or killed. Consider this also. Every time you get behind the wheel of your car, you are also taking into your hands the responsibility for the lives of your passengers and of the people in other vehicles. Ask how you would feel if someone in your family was killed or hurt due to your dangerous actions on the road? How would you feel if you killed or maimed for life, some poor stranger on their way to church? It happens all the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because your mother would be ashamed of you. If nothing else can sway you, the next time you are tempted to engage in some risky behavior on the road, ask yourself what your mother would say if she could see you, right there at that moment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because you are usually a decent human being. Finally, the strange thing about people and cars is, their personality seems to change when they get behind the wheel of a vehicle. Ordinarily kind and decent people cut one another off, change lanes when they shouldn’t, drive fast, or recklessly. Try to remember who you are when you’re not in your car and act accordingly.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
