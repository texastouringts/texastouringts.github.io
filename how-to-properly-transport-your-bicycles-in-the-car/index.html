<h1>How to Properly Transport Your Bicycles in the Car</h1>
<p>Next weekend you will participate in a competition, and you have to move your bicycles in the car. Or you want to take your two-wheeled friend to your vacation destination, and the only way to do it is by using your vehicle.</p>

<p>In this article, we want to tell you several ways to transport your bicycle in the car, but first, you must know that traveling with your bike always implies a particular foresight and also think about where and how you will keep it when you arrive at the destination.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-roof">On the roof</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s ideal if you have a sedan-type car. In principle, it is an excellent place to put it, although you should pay close attention to the underpasses, garages, etc., due to the new height of your vehicle.</p>

<p>You can choose between a system with which the front wheel is disassembled, and the bicycle is held by the toecaps of the fork, or by another that uses a rail in which the bike is fully assembled, and two arms support the frame. The drawback of the latter is that the box can be scratched.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-tailgate">In the tailgate</h2>

<p>Cheap and simple to install, this system is added to the vehicle from behind and with it, up to four bicycles can be moved, depending on the model. Of course, forget the visibility through the rear window and remember that you can not open the trunk with loaded bicycles. Also, bikes can be damaged by contact with one another.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-ball-carrier">In a ball carrier</h2>

<p>Although it is a more expensive system, it is comfortable and allows access to the trunk. It consists of assembling a bike rack for our vehicle that usually carries four bicycles. Remember that, to circulate, you must uninstall it when it is empty. It incorporates its license plate and lights.</p>

<h2 id="in-a-trailer">In a trailer</h2>

<p>It is the most recommended method if you have to transport many bicycles. The trailer is coupled to the vehicle safely, although it is the mode that will most affect your driving due to the increase in dimensions. They have their license plate and lights.</p>

<h2 id="basic-tips"><strong>Basic tips</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/theroofbicycle.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>To avoid compromising your safety and that of other vehicles, and avoid sanctions and immobilizations by traffic agents, remember that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must make sure that the bicycle is firmly attached. Otherwise, you could cause a severe accident and also damage it.</li>
  <li>Try to make your visibility as least compromised as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not forget that bicycles can never protrude beyond the width of the car, including the rear-view mirrors.</p>

<p>Above the maximum will be 4 meters, and ahead or behind the vehicle can stand out, up to a maximum of 10% of the length of the car. In this case, it is mandatory to signal the load with a V-20 plate.</p>

<p>If the bicycles occupy the entire width of the vehicle, you have to place two plates, each at one end of the load.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-affect-driving"><strong>How does it affect driving?</strong></h2>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/thebicycleattached.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Transporting your bicycle in the car entails a series of effects when driving. This is what you should be aware of:</p>

<h2 id="more-fuel-consumption">More fuel consumption</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that driving your bicycle will increase the weight of the load and increase the resistance to air, two factors that directly affect the increase in fuel consumption that your vehicle will make.</p>

<p>It is not an increase that is going to make a hole in your pocket but does not get scared if, at the end of the trip, you go to a service station and the accounts do not come out.</p>

<h2 id="watch-the-tires">Watch the tires</h2>

<p>Regardless of the transportation method you choose, remember that the bicycle or bicycles will increase the weight of the vehicle. Before starting the trip check the tire pressure to make sure it is correct, or you will increase the braking distance dangerously and increase the risk of punctures and blowouts.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-sudden-changes">Avoid sudden changes</h2>

<p>With more weight and more dimensions, your driving must change. Be moderate, take the curves with caution and, in the urban sections, watch the jumps at the speed bumps.</p>

<p>In addition to reducing the danger of the trip, you will reduce your fuel bill, and you will damage the environment less.</p>
