<h1>Guide to Pregnant Driving: What You Should Know</h1>
<p><strong>Pregnant women, especially if it is their first time, face an endless number of new situations that they must assume as naturally as possible. They should vary their daily routine and adapt it to that of their future child.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tips-for-pregnant-driving">Tips for pregnant driving</h2>

<p>Being pregnant is not a contraindication and should not limit your daily life at all, but it is advisable to follow specific guidelines to ensure the welfare of your future child.</p>

<h2 id="seat-belt-placement">Seat belt placement</h2>

<p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends putting it on avoiding, above all, the oppression in the womb. To do this, we must place the lower band of the belt below the belly. The diagonal group is the one that usually produces greater discomfort. The best way to set it is by passing it over the shoulder, between the breasts and surrounding the belly on the top, never above the belly.</p>

<h2 id="distance-with-the-steering-wheel-and-airbags">Distance with the steering wheel and airbags</h2>

<p>It may be advisable to increase the distance with the steering wheel airbags a little, and direct these towards the thorax and the head, not the abdomen. In no case should the airbags be deactivated?</p>

<h2 id="adapts-the-seat-to-the-month-of-pregnancy">Adapts the seat to the month of pregnancy</h2>

<p>It is essential to feel comfortable at the wheel since discomfort can be a distraction. During the first months of pregnancy, it will not be necessary to move the seat, but as the gut grows, it will be required to increase the distance with the steering wheel and adjust the seat to a comfortable and suitable position for driving.</p>

<h2 id="possible-dangers-of-driving-associated-with-pregnancy">Possible dangers of driving associated with pregnancy</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/pregnantdriving.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Certain situations during pregnancy generate discomfort and discomfort that can decrease the ability to react to the wheel, increasing the risk of suffering an accident. Therefore it is not advisable to drive if you are in any of these cases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you have problems such as nausea, swollen legs or low blood sugar that can limit driving ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the sixth month of pregnancy, NHTSA recommends not driving. If it is necessary to drive, it is always recommended to make short trips and in the company of more people.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Being pregnant does not have to be a limitation. Mostly you can follow or adapt the usual activities until an advanced period of gestation. Of course, it is essential to take into account the recommendations and not force yourself to do what may cause discomfort. Each pregnancy is different, so if you have any questions, we recommend you go to a specialist who can advise you on what you need.</p>
