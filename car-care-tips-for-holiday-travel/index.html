<h1>Car Care Tips for Holiday Travel </h1>
<p><strong>Do you know how to take off the vehicle that does so much for you? Do you know when and how often to do specific maintenance on your tip article for you to follow to keep your purring like a kitten?</strong></p>

<p>How often should you change the oil in your vehicle? That depends on your driving style. Most mechanics will tell you three months or 7,500 miles whichever happens first.</p>

<p>Those who do a lot of highway driving or who drive 12,000 miles or less a year do not have to change the oil as often as someone who does a lot of local driving or who puts a lot of mileage on their vehicle.</p>

<p>Have to use your wipers a lot to clean the windshield, you will have to refill the windshield wiper washer fluid more often. Always keep an extra container of wiper washer fluid on hand.</p>

<p>It is essential to keep your wiper blades in good condition so they can do an excellent job of keeping your windshield free of debris and keep the water off your windshield so you can have the clear vision while driving. A good rule of thumb is to change your wiper blades six months.</p>

<p>Here is a tip for saving money - instead of pulling into the shop to have those blades replaced, think about using a parts store to make your blade purchase, it will save you some cash. If you live in a city where winter is particularly brutal, you may want to think about buying Winter Wiper Blades.</p>

<p>No one likes to think about having an emergency while on the road, but we all know they do happen. Here is a list of what your emergency kit should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jumper cables</li>
  <li>Flares</li>
  <li>Reflective triangles</li>
  <li>First-aid kit</li>
  <li>Antifreeze and coolant</li>
  <li>Windshield washer fluid</li>
  <li>Flashlight</li>
  <li>Blanket</li>
  <li>Road atlas</li>
  <li>Map of the area</li>
  <li>Bottled water</li>
  <li>Tire Pressure Gage</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you know that when the temperature outside drops so does the pressure in your tires? It is a good idea to check the pressure in all of your tires.</p>

<p>If you are not sure of what pressure your tires are supposed to be at, look on the side of your door where that white paper is with all the numbers on it, it should state what the best tire pressure is for your tire.</p>

<p>Your manual will also have the information about the best tire pressure to keep your tires at too. It is a myth that low tire pressure gives you better traction in the snow; so keep those tires inflated to the proper tire pressure.</p>

<p>Do not forget to <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/tires">check the tire pressure</a> in your spare tire. If you ever have to use your spare tire, you want it to be the best it can be to get you to safety.</p>

<p>Take a penny with Abe Lincoln’s body between your thumb and forefinger. Put his head into one of the tread grooves on your tire near the place that looks to be the lowest. If any part of Abe’s head is not able to be seen, your tires are OK.</p>

<p>But, if you can see the portion above his head where it says “In God We Trust,” then you need to buy a new tire. If you are not sure how to do this have your mechanic show you the next time you are in.</p>

<p>All-season tires are great for most cars unless you live in an area that experiences deep snow than you may benefit from buying snow tires.</p>

<p>After winter check your headlights and windshield for pitting that is caused by salt or small stones hitting them. Try to get any dings you find polished out because this will reduce your visibility during hazy or foggy days and rainy nights.</p>

<p>Look over your seats to check for holes or rips and repair these before they get worse. The carpets can also use a good cleaning.</p>

<p>Your feet drag in a lot of salt, dirt, and chemicals that are used on the sidewalks and streets during the winter so in early spring is an excellent time to do an excellent cleaning of yours. Take a good look at the finish of your vehicle and repair any scratches, dents, rust spots. Servicing these areas will keep your looking nice and stop rust from getting worse.</p>
