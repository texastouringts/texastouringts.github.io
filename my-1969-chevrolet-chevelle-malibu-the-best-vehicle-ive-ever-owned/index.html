<h1>My 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu: The Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned</h1>
<p>I have owned a few vehicles in my day. However, none have compared to my very first car. It all started when as a teenager and arriving home after my babysitting job and finishing homework, I heard my dad mention that I get “a real job.”</p>

<p>My first thought was that I am already purchasing all of my necessities and I like what I do, simultaneously, I wanted to earn more so I could buy a car.</p>

<p>I was interviewed and hired by our local town movie theatre located 3 miles away. Great! The only slight barrier was no transportation. With my athletic prowess, I was confident that walking to and from part-time employment wouldn’t be a problem.</p>

<p>Starting in June, I trudged along to work in a required polyester uniform in the hot sun. I kept my “great” attitude for a good couple of months, and then every ounce of my energy went into focusing on purchasing a car. Any car at first, as long as it dependably ran.</p>

<p>I searched all of the classified ads and test drove a lot of cars, but unfortunately had no luck in finding a reliable vehicle at the right price. It was then my dad suggested that I call on an acquaintance of his, whose mother had recently passed on, leaving him her 1969 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu.</p>

<p>She had only put 55,000 miles on the car and kept it in mint condition. I don’t know how I was able to talk this gentleman into selling this Malibu to me for only $750 when he was initially asking only $900 for it.</p>

<p>Within a few months, I had earned enough to get it painted a sleek midnight blue, add a complete stereo system, upholster it with plush velour seats, and add conservative mag wheel rims.</p>

<p>I remember not wanting it to resemble an actual muscle car, typical in the late 70s and early 80s mainly because it had a six-cylinder engine, and because mostly only the guys owned them with the eight-cylinder supersport style.</p>

<p>My first car eventually became a conversation piece because of its unique style and because during all of the six years that I had it, it only needed significant maintenance.</p>

<p>After six years, I wanted to transfer my junior college units over to a state college and since money was tight, I somewhat reluctantly sold my car to a friend; I have to say I was glad that she took excellent care of that gem.</p>

<p>After completing college and finding employment, I purchased a new economy car and moved on with life.</p>
