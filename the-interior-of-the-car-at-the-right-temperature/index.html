<h1>The Interior of the Car at the Right Temperature</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/temperatureinsideourcar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having the right temperature inside our car is paramount for our comfort, and also for our safety. The heating is something that all cars had almost since they started using closed bodies, but having air conditioning in the car was not as usual as it is now.</p>

<p>Initially, only the most expensive vehicles had air conditioning, considered almost like an element of luxury. However, at present, air conditioning is an element practically standard in cars, even in the most basic segments.</p>

<p>The technology advances and more and more cars have standard dual conditioners, which allow selecting the interior temperature of the driver’s side and that of the co-driver independently, with a maximum difference that usually ranges between 5 and 7 degrees.</p>

<p>And there are also cars on the market that offer the independent management of temperature in the rear seats and even the third row of those with two extra seats as an option.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-recommended-temperature-inside-your-car">What is the recommended temperature inside your car?</h2>

<p>When driving, it is advisable to do it with few outerwear to have the freedom of movement necessary to move the steering wheel, handle the gear lever and reach all the controls comfortably. For this, it is required to have a suitable temperature inside, where it is not cold.</p>

<p>Nor heat when summer comes. With the air conditioning, we must achieve a suitable temperature, looking for the balance between heat and cold.</p>

<p>The recommended temperature is between 21 and 23 degrees. Circulating at this temperature we will find more comfort and, on a long trip, we will tire less and drive safer. This will help with allergies, sinus infection and with other nasal congestion. Excessive heat reduces the reaction capacity, decreasing reflections.</p>

<p>When in the summer we get into the car, and especially if it has been exposed to the sun for a long time and subjected to excessive temperature, we will have difficulty getting behind the wheel. The plastics or leather interior seats, dashboard, and trim can reach temperatures above 60 ° C with exposure to the sun. And let’s not say the metallic elements.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.texastouringts.com/images/temperatureincar.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We will have to try to start up little by little, allowing the engine of the car to take temperature so that the air conditioning begins to cool with sufficient force. Opening the windows before getting into the vehicle helps overcome the first impact of the internal heat by creating a current that recirculates the air.</p>

<p>It is also advisable, when we start up, to open the windows to recirculate the air - even if hot - and raise them as soon as it starts to cool, with the air conditioning system in the position that collects the air from the outside.</p>

<p>When we notice that the interior temperature is going down, we will place the recirculation mode of the system again so that it is fed with fresher air than the outside and generates cold before. When the air conditioning works at full capacity, we return to the outdoor air mode, so that it is renewed, and we look for the right temperature.</p>

<p>Be careful with placing the air vents directly to the face. Although initially, it helps to refresh us it is advisable to use secondary air to get the ideal temperature.</p>

<p>Keep the air conditioning system ready not to take you unpleasant surprises and that in these conditions do not cool the car. The aeration outlets must be bright, so they do not get clogged, the cabin filter clean so that it performs its function by letting the entire air flow through, and the air conditioning system with enough gas to run us all summer.</p>
