<h1>Lubricating a Model T</h1>

<p>Taking care of business at home is the first thing we need to do before we get out on the road, and as you may well know, keeping your Model T well oiled is one of the best things you can do to keep your car road worthy.</p>
<p>Lubricating these vintage cars is certainly different from lubricating our modern cars.  Our Ts need a squirt of oil here and a squirt of oil there, plus a generous amount of grease applied to various parts of the car.  Ben Hardeman, owner of Texas T Parts in College Station, Texas,  has graciously reproduced a lubrication chart, which illustrates Model T parts requiring periodical lubrication and how often to lubricate them.  The chart  was first printed by the Standard Oil Company in 1927 to use as a handy reference.</p>
<p>So before those Ts are put on the back roads of central Texas,  check out the chart and give your car the oil and grease that it needs to keep running smoothly.</p>
