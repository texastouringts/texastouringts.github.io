<h1>This 1959 Mercedes-Benz Van Can Be Yours</h1>
<p>Born in 1949, the famous Volkswagen Type 2 is undoubtedly the most famous ‘van’ of all time, but in the fifties, it left some lesser-known competitors, such as the impressive Mercedes-Benz O 319 launched in 1955.</p>

<p>At its next auction in Arizona, within a couple of weeks, the specialist RM Sotheby’s is selling a very particular copy, from 1959, completely restored by its owner - over 15 years - and also converted into a suitable camper for any adventure.</p>

<p>Its owner, a computer engineer, wanted to make this 0 319 front engine and unusual design a kind of housing on wheels, which will now go on auction for an estimated price of between 175,000 and 200,000 dollars (between 145,000 and 166,000 euros).</p>

<p>It should be noted that for that same money , or even something less, you could do in the same auction with an SLS AMG Roadster 2012 ($ 150,000 $ -180,000), with its spectacular 6.2-liter V8 atmospheric engine, or with a 190 SL of 1958 ($ 175,000 -200,000), among many other things.</p>

<p>Outwardly this Mercedes-Benz van looks the same original body color and, under its skin, hides a modern pneumatic suspension adapted to the factory configuration of the model, double rear wheel. Inside it has leather seats and even a generously sized bed.</p>

<p>Special mention deserves the electrical work and the endless of accessories that it equips: from additional lighting in any corner to tanks of water and propane installed under the body, a tap, kitchen, water heater or a refrigerator, among other things. It also incorporates two sound equipment, front, and rear, as well as a solar panel to have some electrical autonomy.</p>

<p>According to the auction firm, it equips a modern Mercedes-Benz gasoline injection engine with an automatic transmission and improvements in the cooling system.</p>
